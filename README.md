# Sorcerer Maze Game üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è


## Basic Details
### Team Name: MazeWizards


### Team Members
- Team Lead: Manuratnam - TinkerHub Academy
- Member 2: Sorcerer Sam - Hogwarts School of Development
- Member 3: Maze Master Mike - Labyrinth University

### Project Description
A whimsical maze game where players control a sorcerer navigating through a magical labyrinth, collecting orbs and encountering random fortunes that affect their journey. Built with React and modern web technologies.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
In today's digital age, sorcerers are struggling to maintain their maze-navigation skills due to excessive reliance on teleportation spells. This is causing a crisis in the magical community!

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
We've created a state-of-the-art maze training simulator that forces sorcerers to navigate manually through magical mazes while dealing with random fortunes and maintaining their health. It's like a gym membership for wizards, but more maze-y!

## Technical Details
### Technologies/Components Used
For Software:
- JavaScript/React.js
- HTML5/CSS3
- Testing Libraries (Jest, React Testing Library)
- Modern Web APIs
- Node.js and npm for package management
- VS Code for development

For Hardware:
- A computer (preferably not powered by crystal balls)
- Web browser (dragon-compatible)
- Keyboard for navigation
- Mouse/trackpad (wands not supported yet)
